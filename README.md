# Habitica Sync in Obsidian
This plugin for Obsidian incorporates a view to display and interact with the task management app Habitica.

## Usage
The plugin's view is enabled by clicking on the "Open Habitica Pane" option in the side ribbon. To sync your account, go to the settings page of the plugin and enter your user ID and API token credentials.
## Features
- View current HP and XP
- View todos, dailies, and habits
- Check off tasks/dailies in the view, which sync to habitica website
- Modify habit counters (+/-)
## Settings
- **Habitica User ID:** You can find this by clicking on the "User" icon in the top right of the Habitica webapp, "Settings", then "API"
- **Habitica Token API:** You can find this by clicking on the "User" icon in the top right of the Habitica webapp, "Settings", then "API"

The following two inputs help fetch your user data to be displayed in the Obsidian view.

## Roadmap
We will be implementing additional features including:
- Add/delete/customize tasks and habits
- View/claim rewards
